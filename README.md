# Temperature sensor v2
Second temperature sensor implementation for a ATTiny24a + LM35 + low cost 433Mhz transmitter.
This version targets a very constrained device, the [ATTiny24a](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATtiny24A), whis has only 2k of flash.
The source code does not use the Arduino framework, nor the QP framework as in the first version.
I used Atmel Studio to develop this version.
